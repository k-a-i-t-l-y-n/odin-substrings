# odin-substrings
This repository is my solution for the SubStrings assignment from the Odin Project.

I developed a method that takes a string and an array and returns a hash. 

The array is called a dictionary and consists of letter or words as elements. These elements are used to determine if the text has any values from the dictionary. The values and values' number of occurences in the string are stored in the hash as key-value pair respectively. The hash is then returned.
